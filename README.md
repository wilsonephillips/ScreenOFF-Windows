# ScreenOFF-Windows
Tells your monitor to go directly into powersave mode.

Create a new text file.

Name it ScreenOFF.bat

Edit the file and put in the code.

Place the file anywhere and make a shortcut to it.

Or just download the bat file and use it any way you choose.

It doesn't require powershell to run. It runs from the Command Prompt.

If you do not have git installed, you will get an error message that it cannot find git, but it does not cause the script to fail.
